        Nandi Hills was developed by Ganga Dynasty in 11th century.[7][8] It was
        also used by Tipu Sultan as a summer retreat.[9] Nandidurga was
        traditionally held impregnable, and its storming by the army of
        Cornwallis on 19 October 1791 was one of the most notable incidents of
        the first war against Tipu Sultan of Mysore. A description of the siege
        is given in Browne's History of Scotland[10] and the records of the 71st
        Highlanders.[11] Nundydroog, a celebrated fortress and country of
        Hindostan, in the province of Mysore. The former is built on the summit
        of a rock, about 1700 feet high, three-fourths of its circumference
        being inaccessible. Our forces took it by storm in 1791, after a three
        weeks' siege. It stands in long. 77° 53' E., and lat. 13° 22' N.
        — London Encyclopaedia, 1829[12] It later became a retreat for British
        Raj officials during the hot season. Francis Cunningham built the summer
        residence here for Sir Mark Cubbon. ...this droog, one now used as a
        hotel, built by General Cubbon, sometime British resident; but the rock
        has a bad reputation for malaria, and except in the very dry months is
        shunned by visitors, in spite of its, to the senses, delightful climate
        — Lt. Gen. E F Burton[13] The climate at the top of the hill made it of
        interest to horticulturists. Several species of plant were introduced
        into an experimental garden. Firminger's manual notes that several
        species of Anona were grown at this garden and also notes the
        peculiarity of Hypericum mysorense:[14] H. mysorense.—An ornamental bush
        indigenous to the Western Ghauts, but rarely found in gardens. It is
        domesticated, or wild, in the Fort at Nandidroog, the latter being
        situated on the top of an isolated hill on the plateau of Mysore at an
        elevation of 4,850 feet. This is mentioned, as curiously enough, one has
        to travel more than a hundred miles towards the Western Ghauts, before
        the plant is met with in the wild state again. Fertile seed has never
        been secured. The fine yellow flowers are three inches across. Only
        suitable for the shrubbery in hill gardens. — Burns, 1930[14] Potato
        cultivation was introduced for the first time in the neighbourhood of
        Bangalore by a Colonel Cuppage and continued by the botanist Benjamin
        Heyne. Heyne brought seeds from St. Helena and these grew well enough
        that they were supplied in Madras and preferred to those obtained from
        Bengal.[15] In 1860, tea plants were tried on Nandi Hills by Hugh
        Cleghorn.
